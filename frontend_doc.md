# Using CDHU Whisper

Open Google Chrome and go to https://130.238.146.161/

You will be prompted with a warning that your connection is not private. Click 'Advanced':

And then in the bottom you will now see 'Proceed to https://130.238.146.161'. Click it:

You have now reached the CDHU Whisper Service! Under the bullet you will find three options:
- From URL
- From File
- Record

We will focus on the 'From File' option. Click that and select an audio file from your computer:

A media player with a 'Transcribe' button will appear. Click it to transcribe your audio. When ready, 'Export to TXT'
and 'Export to JSON' buttons will appear. Click 'Export to TXT' to save the transcription on your computer.
